This file describes the panel-mount components.

# Terminology

_Exclusion area_ is the area physically occupied by the component body.
No components may overlap with regard to exclusion area.

_Mask area_ is the area masked by the component's front-side mounting hardware.
No important graphics should exist in the mask area.
Mask area is taken in elevation only, and does not account for parallax.

_Knockout area_ respresents the material physically removed from the panel to 
accomodate the component's pass-through.

# Connectors

Patch connections are made over 1/4" TS phone jacks, of which only the tip 
connection is used.
Switch and relay common terminals are normalized to +12V.
XXX tiepoint connections are provided, XXX(XXX) of which are normalized to
+12V (0V).
All other connections are non-normalized.

- Normalized connectors are Switchcraft 12A.
- Non-normalized connectors are Neutrik NYS229.

Connector dimensions are comparable for both, and rounded up to:

- Exclusion area is a cicle of diameter .770".
  This neglects terminal overlap, which is assumed to be corrected by manual
  rotation of components.
- Mask area is a circle of diameter XXX .591"."
- Knockout area is a circle of diameter XXX.

# Switches

Switches are ON-(ON) SPDT momentary miniature toggle type.
These are part no XXX.

# Lamps

Indicator lamps are accomodated in lamp holder, Dialight part no.

- Exlusion area represents the back-side internally toothed lockwasher, 
  nominal diameter 61/64", rounded to .960".
- Mask area is the front-side mounting flange, nominal diameter 13/16", 
  taken to be .813".
- Knockout area is XXX.

# Keyswitch

Master system power is controlled by a keyswitch, XXX.

# Fuse holder

The system master fuse is mounted on the panel and held in a XXX.
