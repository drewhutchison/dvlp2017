This repository contains resources prepared and collected in support of my talk
planned for presentation at the [Develop Denver](https://developdenver.org/)
conference, August 10th and 11th 2017.

The talk is planned around the use of a purpose-built demonstation unit to
quickly configure and demonstrate the circuits to be discussed, as well as for 
exploration of other circuits at a more leisurely pace.

This repository will contain design files for the demonstration unit and the
[http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/](deck.js)-based presentation slides.

# Abstract

As submitted, the talk description is as follows:

> Three quarters of the twentieth century elapsed prior to the appearance of 
> microprocessors as we've come to know and love them. During this time, there 
> still existed a need for programmatic automation in applications such as 
> industrial and architectural control and telephone switching systems. The 
> technologies and techniques developed to address these needs would end up 
> directly informing the design of later general-purpose computers.

> In this talk, we will physically demonstrate the use of electromechanical 
> hardware available a century ago to create basic logic circuitry. We'll see 
> not only how these circuits underpin modern computer architecture, but also 
> how the design patterns and terminology have remained with us in surprisingly
> recognizable forms. Finally, we'll come to an appreciation of the problems 
> and solutions facing people during what is called (as we'll see, somewhat 
> mistakenly) the "pre-digital era".
